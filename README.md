# Junction 2024, Helsinki - ThriveConnect

The mind breaks under the weight of work when it becomes too much. Yet, companies still don't pay enough attention to this.

## Junction Hackathon
Junction is Europe’s leading hackathon. Among all the challenges, we decided to work on **ThriveConnect**:
<br/>

_Imagine if finding the perfect workplace—a place where you thrive—was as simple as matching your values and needs with an employer's. Your platform could make this vision a reality._
<br/>

## Our idea
Mental health at work is also related to the environment you are in. What if, when looking for a job, you can browse for teams and know the people you might work with, before checking which copmany is offering the job?
<br/>

What if we can exploit machine learning to provide real values and characteristics of a company, based on real employees' reviews?

## INTEAMATE
Swap teams, find jobs.

⚠️ Warning! ⚠️
The application is built for mobile, so we highly recommend experiencing it (both via Figma and the [deployed version](https://junction2024-thrive-connect.vercel.app)). Our front end is currently based on a mock dataset, but the system is designed for easy adaptation to a back-end API interface. While some minor features remain unimplemented, all main functionalities of the app are fully coded. The application is written in Flutter, a framework built on Dart. Flutter’s standout feature is its ability to natively export to multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, and the web (as seen in the deployed version), opening up the potential for future deployment on standard mobile marketplaces.

Additionally, the repository includes a structured set of over 2000 instances of verisimilar data generated specifically for the app’s purpose. A transformer-based algorithm is also included in the code, designed to interpret specific text fields (e.g., reviews and comments) and, using keywords, to determine if opinions are positive or negative. This feature aims to support the ranking system for company well-being. Although the dataset and model are not yet implemented due to network, performance, time, and budget constraints, they can be readily integrated with minimal additional effort.
