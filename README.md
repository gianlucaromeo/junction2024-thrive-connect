# Junction 2024, Helsinki - ThriveConnect

The mind breaks under the weight of work when it becomes too much. Yet, companies still don't pay enough attention to this.

## Junction Hackathon
Junction is Europe’s leading hackathon. Among all the challenges, we decided to work on **ThriveConnect**:
<br/>

_Imagine if finding the perfect workplace—a place where you thrive—was as simple as matching your values and needs with an employer's. Your platform could make this vision a reality._
<br/>

## Our idea
Mental health at work is also related to the environment you are in. What if, when looking for a job, you can browse for teams and know the people you might work with, before checking which copmany is offering the job?
<br/>

What if we can exploit machine learning to provide real values and characteristics of a company, based on real employees' reviews?

## INTEAMATE
Swap teams, find jobs.
